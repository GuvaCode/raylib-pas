# raylib-pas A Pascal Binding for Raylib 2.5.0

raylib-pas is a header translation of the Raylib Game Development Library. It is intended for use with a Shared Library (raylib.dll or raylib.so) From a FreePascal Project. Currently this comes with a 32bit raylib.dll file compiled with the MinGW GCC 8.1.0 32Bit.

Eventually I will be doing some work to compile the project with static linking. Hopefully this will allow for more cross-platform compilation of raylib-pas. Mainly for Android and eventually iOS when raylib supports that.
